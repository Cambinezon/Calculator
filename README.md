# This is my calculator project
If you think about it in some way, you will find the answer on the question "is this a complete calculator update?". The calculator project was caused by my friends and I really thanking them for this.

## In this update I made:
 - textures
 - rendering
 - evaling
 - ability to write numbers and other symbols
 - disability to write letters on key board
 - added buttons(that doesn`t work)

Thank you!
